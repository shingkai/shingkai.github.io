## A New Project

As a serial-starter, I'm constantly tempted to start a new project even though I already have a handful to wrap up. Recently though, I wanted to start a new project with a specific goal in mind: see for myself how much LLMs and AI-assisted coding can allow a competent but non-technical person to build a web-app. My sister is the perfect candidate -- she's spent years as a physics academic but recently joined the darksideat a VC firm. She knows some python and she's programmed a bit here-and-there, but nothing large-scale or visual. As for the project: a few years back, she started making "flow chart recipes", e.g.

My sister was really excited by the idea and she came up with a name for it: Cookflow.

I was thinking that it might be fun to see if we could build a simple webapp in a day that can automatically generate such diagrams. Although I have next to no front-end dev experience, I figured that with AI assistants we should be able to get a basic site working without too much trouble. I was partially right -- I was able to get a basic webapp up and running, but my sister really struggled with figure things out independently, even with AI coding tools (phew, software devs still have job security... for now).

## Building Cookflow

One thing I've discovered from playing around with AI-assisted coding is just how easy its become to get a project started in a new language or framework. Before, I'd look up some potentially useful frameworks, then spend an hour or so going through their "getting started" guide and reading docs to get my bearings. Turns out, AI is really good at summarizing this information and remixing it to make context-specific starter code. In this case, I just asked Claude (3.5 Sonnet) to
> generate a basic html + typescript webapp that has a text input box and parses the input to generate a graphic with d3.js
As expected, it gave us a working starting point -- in this case a simple app that reads text from an input field and generates a histogram of letter frequencies.

We spent most of the afternoon discussing how we would model and store the recipe data. I suggested we define a "Recipe Markup Language" (RML) that could precisely describe a recipe by expressing what ingredients are combined at each step, noting that the output of a step itself may become an ingredient for a later step. We went through a few iterations -- nothing was more helpful than actually taking a sample recipe and attempting to express it in our RML.

After we felt pretty good about our RML definition and sample recipe, we split up to each work on separate parts of the app. I would work on an RMP parsing system that would traverse a recipe definition to extract the nodes and links to be passed to the sankey diagram, while my sister would work on updating the app to generate a d3.js Sankey diagram. I figured that if she worked with hard-coded dummy nodes-and-links data, integration would be relatively simple as long as the data I returned matched the dummy data signature.

My part was fairly straightforward -- I essentially just needed to implement a DFS graph traversal. Every "component" to a step was either a base ingredient (ie leaf node) or output of some prior step (interior node). When I checked in on my sister however, it did not seem like she had nearly as smooth a time. Despite having the d3.js Sankey reference and Claude at her back, she struggled to get the app to plot her dummy data. I had her walk me through her code and development process to try to see where things were going wrong, but it wasn't immediately obvious to me where things were going wrong. It seemed like she was really struggling with Typescript, and the majority of the d3.js resources she found online were for Javascript. I didn't think this would be much of an issue to adapt any sample code, but I now realize that I vastly underestimated how confusing this may be to someone without a real coding background.

By this point about 7 hours or so had passed and it was getting late -- we decided to call it for the night and pick things back up the following week. I couldn't stop thinking about it the next day however--I could just feel that we were _so close_ to having a working POC. Determined to see our Cabbage Pancake recipe in Sankey form, I sat down and took a crack at the Sankey generation myself. Before that however, I did some light refactoring--after a few hours of typescript from the day before, what little prior experience I had started coming back to me, and I re-wrote our RecipeMarkdownLanguation definitions to be more typescript-idiomatic (mostly replacing classes with types). Next was the Sankey generation -- I wasn't a fan of how the project was initially structured (Claude had put all the d3.js chart generation logic directly in the main `app.ts`) so I split the chart generation logic off into its own class. After taking a crack at debugging the code, I just decided to provide Claude with the interface and asked it to re-generate the implementation. Bingo once again, one-shot success. It did take me some more fiddling to get the actual app to work properly--I had initially set the project up as a node project, but this was running as a static client-side webapp, I had to swap the dependencies from npm to sourced from a cdn. This was all very new to me in practice, but very straightforward. There was a bit more fiddling needed to ensure all the imports were working properly -- specifying the script as a module did the trick. The generated sankey recipe diagram finally appeared:

There's still a lot we'd like to do on this project (easier way to define recipes, contextual recipe-colors, search-recipes-by-ingredient, etc) but it was a fun exercise in using LLMs to learn something new.


## Observations on AI-assisted coding

Throughout the past few weeks of hacking on some projects with AI-assistance, I'm starting to come to some conclusions on what I think is the best way to use these tools for myself.

### Ask for More
Ironically, I've found that if you just want to get a POC out, you're better off asking an LLM for more rather than less. Instead of asking for a basic html + css + javascript webapp with placeholders that you will populate later, just try asking for the whole thing first. gpt-4+ and Claude 3.5+ in particular are so good at generating functional one-shot code it's astounding.

### Stick to Popular Frameworks
With the advent of AI-assisted coding, I wonder if the stickiness/network effects of popular frameworks will increase. Well-documented and discussed tools are easier to learn simply because there is more information out there on how to use it. LLMs super charge this -- as there is typically a knowledge cut-off date lag, new languages/frameworks/libraries will be even slower to get adopted by the AI-assisted crowd.

### Expect to Refactor
Maybe this is due to how I've been using AI-assistance to generate code, but I often find that after integrating together a few AI-generated components, the overall codebase feels disjointed and not logically organized. To be fair, I haven't tried any ground-up AI IDEs like Cursor, so maybe this is a problem that can be solved with more context (ie having the entire codebase in context, so the LLM can write more consistent code).
