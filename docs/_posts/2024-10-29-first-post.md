This is the obligatory "first post" of any new blog. I've been thinking of starting a dev journal for a while but I kept putting it off. Github pages makes it easy enough to set one up, so I figured I'd just spend an afternoon getting it going. Hopefully I'll keep up with updating this journal as I make progress on my personal projects.

I have a few intentions with starting this dev journal:

### Get my thoughts written down and out of my head
I've got a lot of ideas for personal projects bouncing around my head, but most of them stay there. My hope is by at least writing them down, I can free up the mental energy spent trying to remember what I thought up in the past. This is pretty much how journaling works in general.

### Keep track of the progress of my personal projects
For the projects that I do start, I have a bad habit of starting them and then getting distracted with another project. When I finally get back around to an older project, I've lost context and then have to spend a bunch of time figuring out what the hell past-me was thinking a year ago. Hopefully with this journal, I can look up posts tagged with the project and simply read up what the hell past me was thinking.

### Hold myself accountable for making progress on these projects
Similar to the previous point, I hope with regular journaling of my personal projects, it'll be easier for me to get a clear picture of when I'm working on my personal projects and how much time I'm putting towards them. I guess I could look at the git histories, but for my non-coding-centric projects this is much trickier.

### Develop my writing style and voice
I used to like writing, but ever since finishing school my writing became almost entirely for work, in the form of emails, technical docs, project proposals, or status reports. This kind of writing kinda sucks -- its important for sure, but it's no fun and I found it really sapped the joy out of writing. It's also typically written in a very neutral voice -- I couldn't really express _myself_ via writing in those contexts. Finally, with LLM-generated text becoming more-and-more common these days, I believe that developing a personal writing style and voice is more important than ever. Because when all the text reads the same, it gets really stale and boring, fast. I think distinctive written voices is one of the qualities that draws me to my favorite writers: Malcolm Gladwell, Haruki Murakami, and Kurt Vonnegut to name a few. They all have an instantly recognizable voice in their writing that makes it so damn fun to read.

### Show off cool shit
The obvious reason for starting a dev journal. Its fun to make cool shit and a big part of that fun is to show it off. Maybe I'll start making little videos to show them off too, but for now a journal seems like a lower-effort medium. Baby steps, y'know?
