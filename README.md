# Note-to-self
_because I'm definitely going to forget how to update this site at some point_

## Adding posts
- Everything goes in the Jekyll root: `/docs`
- posts go into `_posts`
  - posts must be markdown files named starting with the date, e.g. `2024-10-29-POST-NAME.md`

## Testing Locally
### Navigate to Jekyll root:
`cd docs`

### Build site:
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Preview:
